# GitHub Automation Testing Challenge

## Update

### 1.Reason of Testing framework choice

I decide to choose Cypress because this test is front end focused and cypress is designed for the frontend testing. it can easily interacts with elements and interacts. I can also choose playwright that has multiple browser testing. Personally I am more familiar with cypress and it is much more easier to use.

### 2.Local setup

Install http server globally

```console
npm install -g http-server
```

Open another terminal to run the following command to create the index.html in a local host 8080
if local host 8080 is occupied, update in the cypress test calculatorFunctions.js

```console
http-server [path-to-projectfolder]/Test-Development-Engineer-Challenge-2024
```

Open the second terminal to run

```console
npx cypress open
```

## Overview

This repository contains a calculator web application, and your task is to create automated tests and set up continuous integration. The challenge focuses on your ability to implement test automation and configure GitHub Actions.

## The Calculator

The `index.html` file contains a calculator implementation with these features:

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ร, รท)
- Parentheses support
- Decimal numbers
- Calculation history
- Error handling

## Challenge Requirements

### 1. Test Implementation

Choose a JavaScript testing framework (e.g., Jest, Cypress, Playwright) and create test cases for:

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Complex calculations with parentheses
- Error scenarios (invalid expressions, division by zero)
- UI interactions and history functionality

### 2. GitHub Actions Setup

Configure GitHub Actions to:

- Install necessary dependencies
- Run the test suite
- Report test results

### 3. Continuous Integration

Implement automated testing that:

- Runs on every push to any branch
- Runs on pull requests to the main branch
- Ensures all tests pass successfully

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your forked repository locally
3. Create a new branch for your implementation
4. Choose and set up your testing framework
5. Write your test cases
6. Configure GitHub Actions
7. Create a pull request with your solution

## Submission Requirements

1. Test Files

   - Organized test structure
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. GitHub Actions Configuration

   - Workflow file(s) in `.github/workflows`
   - Proper CI pipeline setup

3. Documentation

   - Update README with:
     - Chosen testing framework and rationale
     - Local test setup instructions
     - Any additional configuration requirements

4. Pull Request
   - Create a PR to the main branch
   - Include detailed description of your implementation
   - Leave the PR open for review

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Test Quality (50%)

   - Test coverage completeness
   - Edge case handling
   - Clear test organization

2. CI/CD Implementation (30%)

   - GitHub Actions configuration
   - Automation setup

3. Code Quality (20%)
   - Clean, documented code
   - Clear pull request documentation
   - Quality of README updates

## Optional Enhancements

If time permits, consider implementing:

- Cross-browser testing
- Performance testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
